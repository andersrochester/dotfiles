My dotfiles
I am having a backup of my most important dotfiles.
Noticed the importance of that starting usig vim in development.

It helps me having the same environment in different OSes.

My goal is to be independent of platforms, sort of. Using Darwin(Unix) and different
Linux distrubitions (Manjaro, CentOS, Ubuntu).
